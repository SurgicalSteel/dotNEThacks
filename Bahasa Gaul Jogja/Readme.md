This project is called Bahasa Gaul Jogja translator. The aim of building this software is to make non-Yogyakarta people understand the 'encryption' of slang Javanese which is now rarely practiced in Yogyakarta.

<h1><b>For Example :</b></h1><br>
the word "matamu" (means "your eyes") which is kind of swear word, will be translated into "dagadu"
the sentence "cahe dewe" (means "our kids" or "our friends"), will be translated into "jape methe"

<h1><b>How does the 'encryption method' work?</b></h1><br>
in Javanese script, we know the list of consonant letters, they are :

ha na ca ra ka
da ta sa wa la
pa dha ja ya nya
ma ga ba tha nga

And native Yogyakarta people then created the encryption by swapping the first two lines with the last two lines, into :

pa dha ja ya nya
ma ga ba tha nga
ha na ca ra ka
da ta sa wa la

So we can see the mapping between those two collections of consonants, right? Can you see the mapping?
We only use the consonants to encrypt the message, while vocal letters remain unchanged.
example for the sentence "cahe dewe" -> "jape methe"

ca -> ja
he -> pe
de -> me
we -> the

If you find any bug, feel free to report it to me.
Use this software at your own risk!
Enjoy! :)
